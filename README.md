# Plover Velotype

Velotype-esque typing for Plover.

## Development Status

This project is largely for personal use, and no gurantees of function, form or sanity can be given.
While every attempt will be made to fix any bugs found in this project, nothing is guranteed.

## Affiliation

This project is not affiliated with the makers of the Velotype keyboard in any way,
it's just a crude approximation of the keyboard's functioning onto Plover.

## Installation

This package provides a Plover System and and Extension.
Without the extension active, strokes will not be split up correctly, and the keyboard will not work.
If the system is set to anything other than Velotype, the extension will not interfere with normal operation.

## Technical Details

To be completed.
